A simple Density Matrix Renormalization Group program

Description is on Computational Physics blog: http://compphys.go.ro/density-matrix-renormalization-group/

The program can be compiled with Visual C++ on Windows (native, with mfc). 
It uses Eigen library for matrices.

Currenly only Heisenberg chains are implemented (both spin 1/2 and 1).
